# Angular 2 Components

I have been writing UI components over and over for each application I worked on in the past and I decided now that Angular 2 is out to work on a base library that support all UI components I normally use and some others that I know are very useful too. This project is in a very early stage now but I wanted to publish it to start getting feedback. I am working on adding more components and also improving the documentation. In the mean time you can go to: https://orlaqp.github.io/ng2-material-components/ to check some demos.
